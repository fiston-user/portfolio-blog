Patch management is the process of identifying, testing, and updating software applications with security fixes, bug fixes, or new features. It is an essential part of maintaining the security and functionality of any software product, especially in the cloud environment where threats are constantly evolving, and customer expectations are high.

App developers need to perform regular patching to protect the app and its users from cyberattacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in the software. These vulnerabilities can range from low to critical in terms of their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation. By assigning a risk ranking system, developers can prioritize resources effectively to help reduce the attack surface and mitigate the risk of data breaches, service disruptions, or reputational damage.

Patching helps improve the performance and reliability of the app by resolving issues that may affect its functionality or user experience. These issues can include bugs, errors, compatibility problems, or performance degradation. Patching helps ensure that the app delivers the expected results and meets customer satisfaction and retention goals.

## Microsoft 365 Certification Validates Patch Management Best Practices

One of the key aspects of Microsoft 365 Certification is the validation of patch management controls. App developers need to show they have a documented and effective patch management process that identifies and assesses patches that are relevant to the app and its dependencies. This includes scanning the app and its components for vulnerabilities, reviewing the available patches from the vendors or sources, and evaluating their applicability and suitability for the app.

Auditors will ensure that prioritization and scheduling of patches are based on their severity and impact, and mitigation occurs within a reasonable patching window. Patches should be ranked according to their risk level, urgency, and dependency to help determine the optimal time and frequency for applying them to the app.

Certification confirms patches are tested and verified before they are deployed into the production environment in a separate or isolated environment, verifying their functionality
